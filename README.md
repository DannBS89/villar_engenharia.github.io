## About This Project

This project represents my first venture into the world of programming, and it has been quite a journey! It began as a challenge to create something from scratch, and along the way, I learned invaluable skills and gained a deeper understanding of how software development works.

As a newcomer, I encountered various hurdles, from debugging code to understanding the logic behind algorithms. Each obstacle taught me something new, and I found joy in overcoming these challenges. The process of transforming an idea into a functional application was both rewarding and inspiring.

This project not only helped me develop technical skills but also ignited my passion for programming. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring new technologies in the future. I hope this project inspires others who are just starting their journey in programming, proving that with perseverance and curiosity, anything is possible!

tank you rocketseat team!
